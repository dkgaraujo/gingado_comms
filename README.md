> Note: `gingado` is still being developed, so differences between presentations/working paper versions are to be expected and reflect the normal development process.

Any comments, suggestions, questions or criticisms on issues are [welcome](https://github.com/dkgaraujo/gingado_comms/issues)! The paper is being developed "in the open", which means my intention is to be transparent with respect to how I address the feedback received from others.
